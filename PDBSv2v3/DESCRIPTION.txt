PDBSv2 (protein backbones):
This dataset contains 40 proteins represented by the backbones of the proteins coming from the 
crystallography downloaded from JenaLib and RCSB. converted to graphs by BALL library . They are 
medium sparse graphs. They may have from 1683 to 7979 vertices per graph. Pattern graphs were 
extracted from the corresponding target graphs as we have done for dataset PDBSv1. We create seven 
groups of 10 random patterns, re ecting the typology of the target graphs, having a number of edges 
equals to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256.

PDBSv3 (contact maps):
This dataset contains 50 contact maps of the amino acids of the domains of the proteins, retrieved by 
CMView. They represent relationships among amino acids. Contact maps are small dense graphs. In 
average a graph may have 380 vertices. Since target graphs are dense, we extracted from them different 
types of pattern graphs (from dense to sparse) to vary the performance comparisons. Patterns were 
generated from the corresponding target graphs giving the number of desired edges. Dense patterns are 
constructed by forcing the number of vertices to be approximately equal to 25% of the number of edges. 
Semi-dense patterns have a number of vertices almost equal to 50% of the number of edges. For the 
sparse patterns the percentage of vertices is set to 90% and cycles avoid simple structures as paths. 
Each pattern tends to reach the desired percentage of vertices. For each density of patterns, we 
create seven groups of 10 random patterns having a number of edges equals to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 
and 256.

Undirect graphs

Format:

#GraphName
NumberOfNodes
NodesAttributesList
...
NumerOfEdges
Source Target


GraphName and Attributes can not contain blanks (spaces, tabs, etc...)
Node ids are assigned implictly by attributes orderstarting from 0.

#graph
3
A
B
C
2
0 1
1 2

A graph with 3 nodes and 2 edges.
A has id 0, B has id 1, C has id 2.

Since graphs are undirect, if edges  (0,1) is presente then edge (1,0) can not be present in edges lists.


Queries are expressed by size (number of edges).


Each folder is releted to a protein.


Given the protein 1A0G:
 - 1A0G/1A0G.gff is the backbone structure
 - 1A0G/1A0G.h.gff is the backbone structure plus hydrogens
 - 1A0G/1A0G.cm.* are the structures of the protein domains
 - 1A0G/queries  contains the queries extracted from each type of structure
 - 1A0G/queries/cmap/query_[SIZE]_[DOMAIN].05.gff are dense queries
 - 1A0G/queries/cmap/query_[SIZE]_[DOMAIN].025.gff are semi dense queries
 - 1A0G/queries/cmap/query_[SIZE]_[DOMAIN].gff are sparse queries


The folder "grouped" contains sets of compound structures and query graphs grouped by type.
The target database of protein backbones is "grouped/backbones_all.gff.
The target database of contact maps is "grouped/cmap_all.gff.
