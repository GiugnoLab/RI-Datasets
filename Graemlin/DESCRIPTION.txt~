This dataset contains 10 microbial networks (Campylobacter jejuni, Caulobacter crescentus, 
Helicobacter pylori 26695, Salmonella typhimurium LT2, Synechocystis PCC6803, Vibrio cholerae, 
Escherichia coli K12, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4, 
Streptomyces coelicolor ). The dataset is proposed with original unique labels, and varying the number 
of assigned random labeled from 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, to 2048.Labels are assigned using a 
uniform distribution. We create sets of 20 dense, semidense and sparse patterns for each pattern 
dimension (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, to 256).

Undirect graphs

Format:

#GraphName
NumberOfNodes
NodesAttributesList
...
NumerOfEdges
Source Target


GraphName and Attributes can not contain blanks (spaces, tabs, etc...)
Node ids are assigned implictly by attributes orderstarting from 0.

#graph
3
A
B
C
2
0 1
1 2

A graph with 3 nodes and 2 edges.
A has id 0, B has id 1, C has id 2.

Since graphs are undirect, if edges  (0,1) is presente then edge (1,0) can not be present in edges lists.


Queries are expressed by size (number of edges).


The dataset is primarly split by number of lables: 1, 32, 64, ..., 2048 and unique labels.


Each sub dataset [#LABELS] contains:
 - [#LABELS]/*.net  original strctures relabeled with #LABEL labels
 - [#LABELS]/q	sparse queries
 - [#LABELS]/q0.5	semi dense queries
 - [#LABELS]/q0.25	dense queries
 - [#LABELS]/all/db.gfd	the entire set of target graphs
 - [#LABELS]/all/q*.all	sets of queries grouped by density
