This dataset contains 10 networks describing the known and predicted protein interactions downloaded 
from STRING. We used the following organisms: Mus musculus, Saccaromyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis 
elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Takifugu rubipres, Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis, Bos taurus, 
Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens. They are large dense graphs. The original version of the dataset 
having unique node labels (protein ids) is also randomly relabeled with 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 
and 2048 number of labes. Labels are assigned using a uniform distribution and a normal distribution 
(gaussian). We extracted from the target graphs sets of 20 dense, semidense and sparse patterns for 
each pattern dimension (the number of edges vary from 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, to 256).

Undirect graphs

Format:

#GraphName
NumberOfNodes
NodesAttributesList
...
NumerOfEdges
Source Target


GraphName and Attributes can not contain blanks (spaces, tabs, etc...)
Node ids are assigned implictly by attributes orderstarting from 0.

#graph
3
A
B
C
2
0 1
1 2

A graph with 3 nodes and 2 edges.
A has id 0, B has id 1, C has id 2.

Since graphs are undirect, if edges  (0,1) is presente then edge (1,0) can not be present in edges lists.


Queries are expressed by size (number of edges).

The dataset is primarly split by label distribution type.



Each distribution type is split by number of lables: 1, 32, 64, ..., 2048 and unique labels.
- "unique" contains the original dataset with unique labels
- "sdistr" contains the dataset labeled with normal distribution (gaussian)
- "udistr" contains the dataset labeled with uniform distribution (flat)

Each sub dataset [DISTR]/[#LABELS] contains:
 - [DISTR]/[#LABELS]/*.gfd  original strctures relabeled with #LABEL labels
 - [DISTR]/[#LABELS]/q-1/[NET].[SIZE].*	sparse queries
 - [DISTR]/[#LABELS]/q0.5/[NET].[SIZE].*	semi dense queries
 - [DISTR]/[#LABELS]/q0.25/[NET].[SIZE].*	dense queries
 - [DISTR]/[#LABELS]/db.all	the entire set of target graphs
 - [DISTR]/[#LABELS]/all/q*.all	sets of queries grouped by density
