This dataset contains 30 graphs with data from DNA, RNA, and proteins having up to 33067 vertices. 
Original structures can be downloaded from the JenaLib and RCSB. Downloaded molecules in PDB format 
were converted in graphs using BALL. The dataset mostly contains large sparse graphs. 
Pattern graphs were extracted from the corresponding target graphs fixing the number of wanted edges. 
Patterns are subgraphs (monomorphisms) of their corresponding target graphs. We create six groups of 
10 random patterns having a number of edges equals to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128.

Undirect graphs

Format:

#GraphName
NumberOfNodes
NodesAttributesList
...
NumerOfEdges
Source Target


GraphName and Attributes can not contain blanks (spaces, tabs, etc...)
Node ids are assigned implictly by attributes orderstarting from 0.

#graph
3
A
B
C
2
0 1
1 2

A graph with 3 nodes and 2 edges.
A has id 0, B has id 1, C has id 2.

Since graphs are undirect, if edges  (0,1) is presente then edge (1,0) can not be present in edges lists.


Queries are expressed by size (number of edges).


The folder "singles" contains compound structures and related extracted queries.


The entire set of compound strcutures is grouped into grouped/singles_all.gff.
Queries are grouped by size in "grouped/queries_[SIZE]_all.gff"
