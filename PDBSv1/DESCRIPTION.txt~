1 2

A graph with 3 nodes and 2 edges.
A has id 0, B has id 1, C has id 2.

Since graphs are undirect, if edges  (0,1) is presente then edge (1,0) can not be present in edges lists.


Queries are expressed by size (number of edges).


The folder "singles" contains compound structures and related extracted queries.


The entire set of compound strcutures is grouped into grouped/singles_all.gff.
Queries are grouped by size in "grouped/queries_[SIZE]_all.gff"
