AIDS dataset contains the topological structures of 40000 chemical compounds that have been tested 
for evidence of anti-HIV activity (available from NCBI). Compounds are undirected graphs where the 
number of vertices varies from 4 to 245. They are small sparse graphs. Since the AIDS dataset 
contains relatively small graphs, the patterns are graphs of the dataset. Patterns were divided 
into four groups, each group has 100 graphs, and each graph may have 4, 8, 16 or 32 vertices. The 
topology of patterns was chosen in order to respect the average degree and label distribution of 
the target graphs. This implies that patterns were often quite complex.

Undirect graphs.

Format:

NumerOfEdges
Source Target


GraphName and Attributes can not contain blanks (spaces, tabs, etc...)
Node ids are assigned implictly by attributes orderstarting from 0.

#graph

A
B
C
2
0 1
1 2

A graph with 3 nodes and 2 edges.
A has id 0, B has id 1, C has id 2.

Since graphs are undirect, if edges  (0,1) is presente then edge (1,0) can not be present in edges lists.


Queries are expressed by size (number of edges).
